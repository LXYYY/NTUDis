%SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is an important component of robot systems, enabling robot systems to exploit and map an unknown environment, while estimating its own position. Single robot SLAM techniques based on monocular or stereo cameras, color or depth images and segmentation- or feature-based algorithms, have been considerable developed with many successful solutions proposed, during years of research. 

Multi robot SLAM systems have several advantages e.g. robustness and quicker exploration, which determine they have better performance and importance than single robot SLAM especially in time critical Search and Rescure missions. 
However, the development of multi robot SLAM is much slower, because of the difficulties such as determination of relative poses of robots and communication, etc. 
CORB-SLAM as a multi robot SLAM system, of which the clients are based on ORB-SLAM2, inheriting its advantages like low-cost sensor configuration and low computation cost, has not been evaluated in a quantitative method to assess its performance. 
For multi robot SLAM, the adaptability in long-term scenarios is another important research topic, since multi robots may run in different dates and seasons.
 Because CORB-SLAM does not employ extra algorithms to suppress illumination changes, its long-term performance is limited.
This work quantitatively evaluates CORB-SLAM, and experiments to combine it with illumination variance algorithm to improve its performance under different illumination and season.
