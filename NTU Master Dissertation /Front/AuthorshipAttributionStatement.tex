This dissertation is finished under the guidance of Professor Wang Danwei, in ST Engineering-NTU ROBOTICS ADVANCe LABORATORY in NTU.
I sincerely thank Professor Wang and his PhD students Zhang Jun, Peng Guohao, Yue Yufeng for their patient and careful help during the implementation, experiment and compilation of the dissertation. 
Without their help on providing technical suggestions and possible solutions to the research objectives, and help during the collection of the related datasets, this dissertation project would not go so smoothly within two short semesters.
